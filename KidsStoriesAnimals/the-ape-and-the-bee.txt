Once, an Ape saw thick syrup under a tree. The syrup looked golden in the sunshine. The Ape saw more drops of the syrup falling from a branch of the tree.The Ape thought, ‘Oh! That must be honey!’The Ape looked up. He saw high above him, a hive. He also saw that the Bees were buzzing and working together to make honey.The Ape wished that he could climb up, break off a piece of the hive, chew it and enjoy the fresh honey! But he did not move at all. He sadly remembered, Just last week, I had tried to steal honey from the hive and the angry Bees had stung me! It was so painful!’The Ape sighed!A Bee flying up to the hive looked at him. The Ape asked the Bee, “How are you able to make such a sweet wonderful liquid like honey, and at the same time, carry such a horribly painful sting?”The Bee nodded wisely and agreed, “Yes, you know our good work tastes sweet; but you must also know that when someone tries to steal it, our anger can be just as bitter!”If you learn from your mistakes, you will not get hurt again. 5423
