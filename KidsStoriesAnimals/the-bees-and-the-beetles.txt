Far away on the hills, there was a forest full of many different trees and plants. Different kinds of animals, birds and insects lived in the forest.There was a huge beehive on a tall tree. The Bees were always busy collecting honey and filling their combs.On another old tree, close to the tree with the beehive, was a colony of Beetles. They lived in the old tree trunk.The Bees and Beetles were very good neighbours.They never troubled each other and always went their own ways. They lived peacefully with each other.One day, the friendly Bees invited the Beetles for dinner.  The Beetles arrived and dinner was served.The Bees offered the Beetles some of the best honey that they had.The Beetles did not like the taste of honey. They barely ate anything and then flew away.The next day, all the Beetles invited the Bees over for dinner. A plate full of dung was served to the Bees. The Bees could not eat even a single bite. They remained hungry and flew back home.Two people can have different likes and dislikes,but still they can be good friends.
