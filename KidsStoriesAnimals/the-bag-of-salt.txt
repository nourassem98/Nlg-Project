The lion, the hyena, the tiger, the zebra, the ostrich and the snake met at the waterhole. Just then, the lion spotted a bag on the ground. He sniffed at it and cried, “It’s salt!” They were very excited. The zebra said, “Let’s eat it.” So, the ostrich pecked a hole in it and the salt trickled out. All the animals took turns in tasting it. Very soon, they began to fight over who should keep the salt. A clever jackal was passing by. He told them, “Close your eyes and count to hundred. Whoever finds it first, can keep it,” he said. When the animals opened their eyes they found both the jackal and the bag gone! 3571
