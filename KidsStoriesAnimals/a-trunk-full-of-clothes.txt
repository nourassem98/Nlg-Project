Once upon a time, there lived a bear named Bartholomew who was loved by one and all in the jungle. One day, while Bartholomew went to the river to fish, he noticed a huge trunk. He nudged the cover and after much effort opened it. “What colourful clothes,” he exclaimed. “There are caps, pants, shirts, suits!” Bartholomew quickly took out, a shirt, a hat and a pair of trousers. Once he was ready, he went to the river to see his reflection. Suddenly, the monkey noticed him and swooped down to enquire. Bartholomew showed him the trunk full of clothes. Soon word spread and all the animals gathered around Bartholomew. Each wanted something to wear. Soon a tussle broke out. They snatched, pulled, pushed and scratched. ‘Stop it!” screamed Bartholomew. All the clothes in the trunk were torn into pieces and none had anything to wear. “Can’t help you because you had your chance as well,” pointed Bartholomew and walked away. 4536
