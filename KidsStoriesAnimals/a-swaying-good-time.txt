Bobo the monkey climbed a coconut tree. Soon the breeze began to blow a little stronger and the tree swayed from side to side. The coconuts started falling to the ground. Bobo held onto a coconut so that he would not fall. But there was sudden gush of wind and he fell down with a loud thud. More coconuts fell and hit Bobo on the head. Bobo thought it might be fun to hold the trunk and sway along with it. So that’s what he did. “Whee!” he said and had a swaying good time! Then he fell for the second time. This time Bobo found a cave and rested there till the storm was over. 3561
