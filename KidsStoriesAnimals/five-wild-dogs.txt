There was a river in a forest. Once, it rained so much that the water in the river rose over the bank. Soon, there was a flood in that part of the forest.All the animals’ houses were under water. Then, Five Wild Dogs saved many animals from drowning.Soon, the rains stopped and the water level in the river fell again.The King of the Forest, the Lion, was very happy with the Five Wild Dogs. He called all the animals of the forest for a meeting and said, “These are brave and kind Dogs. They will eat with me, in my den, for a week. You must all respect them, too.All the animals clapped their hands. Then, suddenly, a Rabbit said to the Lion, “Your Majesty, these Five Wild Dogs are not brave or kind. I heard them talking among themselves, this morning. They said that they had savedthe animals so that they could eat them later.”The Lion was very angry with the Five Wild Dogsand shouted, “Get out of my forest, you selfish fellows!”Good deeds done for a selfish motive, are notworthy of praise. 6459
