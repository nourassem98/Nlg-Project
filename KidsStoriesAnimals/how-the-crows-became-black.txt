Long ago, the crow used to be a white bird. In his neighbourhood, lived an owl who had a dye shop. The crow was fascinated by the myriad colours. He flew down to the owl’s shop and asked if his white body could be coloured. “I want to be the most beautiful bird in the world,” he said. The owl agreed and asked him to come the next day. Now the owl was slightly blind but he was too vain to wear spectacles. While mixing the colours for the crow, he poured black instead of lilac. The crow arrived early the next day. “There you are!” said the owl “Your colours are ready. Just dive into that pool of water.” The crow lost no time and dived in. But alas! When he emerged, he saw that he was dark in colour. He seethed with anger and cawed at the owl, “Why have you made me black? Wait till I catch you!” The frightened owl flew away and came out only at night when the crow was asleep. Since then, crows are black and owls’ venture out only at night. 4541
