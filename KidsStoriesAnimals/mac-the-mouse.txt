Tom the cat always chased Mac the mouse. One day when Mac sneaked into the kitchen, Tom set chase again. Mac ran for his life and hid inside the library. While Tom watched the entrance of the library, Mac found a pile of interesting books. He read them and gained knowledge on how to outsmart a cat. However, after a while he was hungry. Peeking around, he noticed Tom—fast asleep. Mac tiptoed across and was about to enter the kitchen, when he heard a loud, “Meow!” He jumped out of the kitchen and ran inside his hole. As Tom guarded the hole all day, Mac thought, “I might not have learnt how to outwit a cat as yet, but I have learnt enough to save myself.” 3580
