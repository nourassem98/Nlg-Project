Bright Eyes was a possum, who lived with his parents. He used to live in his mother’s pouch. As the days passed, he grew a furry coat, pink ears and nose and a fluffy tail. One fine day, Bright Eyes’ mother climbed up a big tree on whose branches was hanging a big beehive. Bright Eyes popped his head out of the pouch and saw the big beehive. “What is that?” he asked his mother. His mother explained to him how he could collect the honey. After this, his father came and showed him how to glide. He asked Bright Eyes to expand his flying skin. This skin would help him keep afloat. He then held out his tail straight and leapt forward. Bright Eyes was very excited for now he could fly like a free bird. “Marvelous!”  exclaimed his father who was watching his son joyfully. Bright Eyes went round and round then down and down and finally took a sharp curve and soared higher.”I can fly!” exclaimed Bright Eyes. 4531
