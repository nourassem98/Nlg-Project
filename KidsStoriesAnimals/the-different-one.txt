Once a Lion and a Lioness lived in a forest with their twin cubs. One day as usual the Lion went out to hunt for food but it being an unlucky day he did not find any. On his wav hack he saw a jackal cub and brought him home.“Dear I did not find any food today. I think we can forgo our meal but the kids need food and this jackal cub would suffice them,” said the Lion.At this the Lioness said, “No, dear, I cannot be so cruel. I am a mother and after all this is a young baby. I will bring it up as my son.”So it came to be that the baby jackal stayed with the lion’s family and grew into a young and healthy jackal.. The time came when the Lioness taught the jackal and her two sons the art of hunting. Soon they were skilled at hunting small rabbits and deer.One day when out for their hunt the three encountered a mad elephant. The lion cubs, fearless as they were approached the wild beast to kill it but the jackal said to them, “No, brothers, do not go near him for elephants are our enemy. You will be killed.”Hearing this the valiant Lion cubs lost courage and shrunk back.At home they narrated the incident to their mother, the Lioness. The Lioness took the jackal aside and advised, “You are valiant in your own right and though I fed you my own milk and brought you up as my son you are still a jackal. If you tease my sons their lion spirit would at once react someday and you shall be sorry for that. Now you are young and do not know the difference between the lions and the jackals, I ask you to go away to your own kind. Go and join them before it’s too late.”The jackal understood the logic of the Lioness’ talk and stole away stealthily to join his own kind.MORALA Jackal remains a Jackal. 4762
