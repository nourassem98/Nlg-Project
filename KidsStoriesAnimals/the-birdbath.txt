A little girl called Megan had a birdbath in her backyard. Every day she would fill it with fresh water and many birds would come flocking to wash their wings and tails. One day Megan’s friend, Gina came over. “Let’s go and play,” she said, “you can fill the birdbath later.” Megan hesitated but Gina was in such a hurry that she agreed. Since there was no water, the birds were disappointed and flew away. When Megan came back, her father showed her a lone blue bird that had been waiting all day. “That bird is also your friend. Megan. You have to think about her too.” he said. Megan filled the birdbath and the blue bird splashed happily in it. To Megan’s delight, all the birds were back the next day. 3550
