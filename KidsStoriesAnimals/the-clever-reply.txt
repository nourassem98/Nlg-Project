One day the lion, the king of the jungle, called an important meeting at his den. The lion was very dirty and so was his den. Unable to bear the smell, the zebra covered his nose. “How dare you cover your nose? Does my den stink?” roared the lion. The zebra had no adequate reply and the lion threw him out of the den. The king then asked the elephant the same question. “No, it smells of roses,” replied the frightened elephant. The lion wasn’t happy with this reply either and knocked the elephant’s trunk. He then asked the fox. “Sir, I have a cold so I cannot smell anything,” replied the intelligent fox. The lion was happy with this clever reply and made the fox his minister. 4496
