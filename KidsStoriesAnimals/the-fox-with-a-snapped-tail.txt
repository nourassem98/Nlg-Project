Once, Kallu the fox, was wandering in the forest when his tail got stuck in a snare. He pulled at it so hard that the tail snapped and a part of it remained in the trap. Kallu was very sad and envied the other foxes who had bushy tails.He said to the other foxes, “You know friends, these tails are useless extensions to our bodies. They feel very odd and they look so bad! I suggest you cut them off! Look how freely I walk about!”The other foxes saw through his jealousy and told Kallu, “If you are so free and feel good without your full tail, then why are you looking so unhappy without one?” Kallu quickly left the place in shame. 4547
